- Pacman can explore and use the side escapes properly(and parents matrix (dir calculation) is proper)
- Add scale in time to positive scores(food, booster, quests etc.)
- Add huge penalty for trying to discover goals through a ghost
- Add ghost kill streak(especially for quest)
- Add ghost statistics collection for calculating the expected step(and logic)
- Add ghost tracking statistics(have we killed it in this booster dur. or the in the whole game)
- Change ghost kill mode when in boost mode (right now, we only take account to ghosts when the rem boost time is below 1/4)
- Collect and adjust heat parameters
- Write useful logging function especially for heatmap

Additional Ideas:
## Add more heat for utility points nearby
## Distributed positive heat generation
## Search for safety places => bonus heat for them
## Dont search paths which goes though a ghost when a ghost is 7(or x) distance away
## Bonus heat for territories/field when a certain criteria meets (example: 25 food in 6 radius neighbourhod, safe, close)
## => So its basically a mixture of previous ones
